geogigpy
========

A Python library to use GeoGig.

This library is designed to provide access to all GeoGig functionality, so it can be used to script tasks or as the base library for a GeoGig client.

Python version: 2.7 or 3.x


Installation
-------------

To install, use ``pip`` or ``easy_install``:

::

	$ pip install geogig-py

or

::

	$ easy_install geogig-py

For developers wanting to improve or modify ``geogig-py``, you should clone the GitHub repo and then install the library in a virtual environment, following these steps

::

	$ git clone git://github.com/boundlessgeo/geogig-py.git
	$ cd geogig-py
	$ python setup.py develop (virtualenv of your choice)


GeoGig is not included with geogig-py, and it you have to install it separately

Usage
-----

Usage is described `here <./doc/source/usage.rst>`_.

Examples
--------

You can find `here <./doc/source/examples.rst>`_ some examples on how to use geogig-py for basic and more complex scripting tasks.



Architecture. Connectors
-------------------------

The ``repo`` object delegates most of its work to a connector, which communicates with a GeoGig instance. Currently there are two connectors available:

- A CLI-based connector, which uses the console to call the GeoGig command-line interface and parses its output. It assumes that GeoGig is installed in your system and available in your current PATH. Basically, if you open a console, type ``geogig`` and you get the GeoGig help, you are ready to use a ``geogig-py`` repository using the CLI connector. This is far from efficient, as it has to call GeoGig (and thus, start a JVM) each time an operation is performed.

- A Py4J-based connector, which communicates with a GeoGig gateway server. To start the server, you have to run ``geogig-gateway`` on a console. The server is part of a standar GeoGig distribution.

By default, a ``Repository`` object uses a Py4J-based connector if no connector is passed.

Testing
--------

To run unit tests, just run the ``test.py`` module in ``src/test``. Most of the tests are integration tests, but test data is included and the only requisite is to have GeoGig installed and correctly configured. The geogig-gateway must be running
